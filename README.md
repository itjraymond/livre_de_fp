# Un Livre de Functional Programming

Waring: This may not result in anything as my motivation is spread to so many things.

Note: main branch will not expose the chapters ;-)

All the concepts will not be particular to any programming language.  In fact, I should
use several programming languages to show the concept.  Programming language such as Java,
Kotlin, Groovy, Scala, F#, Haskell and Erlang.

- Title: work in progress

- Chapter 01: work in progress
- etc...

Note: First step will be to create a scratch pad to keep track of possible ideas, resources
worth reading and so forth.
